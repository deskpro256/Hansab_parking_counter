Here is the link to download windows version of ampronLED software:
http://cloud.ampron.eu/HF5Lc8

Unzip it to desired folder and run as administrator with command "ampronled-mlds-2.1.36-win.exe start".

We also included example configuration files for you to get things up faster.

Double-check that Windows has Microsoft Visual c++ redistributable v13 installed on the machine before starting the app. To run it as a service we suggest to use NSSM.

If you get stuck at any point, then just let us know and we will guide you through.
