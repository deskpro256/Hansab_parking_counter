The name that you find on the router is what the W5500 sent during DHCP exchange procedure.
If you used the DHCP client source code example downloaded from WIZNET site thenâ€¦
open ioLibrary\Internet\DHCP\DHCP.h and just change the definition in this line

#define DCHP_HOST_NAME     "WIZnet\0"
with what you want and recompile everything.
